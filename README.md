# Pocohunter
Idea is to create nethunter supported beryllium kernel and add new features to it. But I can't give ETA when I add releases to kernel. When I have time then I will try to create new version and add it here. Sry bad English.

*  Recommended ROM is Lineage OS 16
*  You can download chroot from https://build.nethunter.com/kalifs/kalifs-latest/
*  (you can also use arm64 version) and choose kalifs-armhf-minimal.tar.xz or kalifs-armhf-full.tar.xz and place it in internal storage then rename kalifs-armhf-   minimal.tar.xz to kalifs-minimal.tar.xz. If thats done open nethunter and install chroot manually.
