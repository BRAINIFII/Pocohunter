#### This kernel should work with Nethunter and Andrax. Remember i am just doing this project because i am interested in these things and if something dosent work then it dosent. Just wait for next release or create an issue [HERE](hhttps://github.com/Martinvlba/Pocohunter/issues "Issues") and i will try to look into it. Thank you for reading me.
